- Sentinel-1 GRD-EW processing pipelines 
    - create time-series of small fixed areas of interest (e.g., at oil seep location) with pixel-level accuracy
    - compare SNAP's and custom quantative data processing steps (e.g. thermal noise-removal, calibration, speckle filtering)

- Sentinel-1 dataviewer

- Other scripts
